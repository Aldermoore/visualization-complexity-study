## Title of Research Study: Measuring Data Visualization Complexity
## Introduction
You are being asked to participate in a research study. Before you
              agree, however, you must be fully informed about the purpose of
              the study, the procedures to be followed, and any benefits, risks

              that you may make a fully informed decision regarding your
              participation.

## Purpose of the Study
Visual representations of data (visualizations) are increasingly
common in everyday life. The purpose of this study is to learn
more about what makes some data visualizations perceive as more complex than others. 

## Tasks
The test contains 50 data visualizations, with two task per visualization. 
It will take approximately 15 minutes to finish this test.

## Benefits to research participants and others:
The possible benefits include exposure to interesting data
visualization, along with helping inform the
development of future experiment reporting techniques.

## Record keeping and confidentiality
Records of your participation in this study will be held
confidential so far as permitted by law. However, the study
investigators will be able to inspect and have access to
